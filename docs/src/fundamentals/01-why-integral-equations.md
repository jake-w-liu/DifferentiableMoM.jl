# Why Integral Equations

## Purpose

This chapter establishes the mathematical and physical foundations of the Integral Equation Method of Moments (IE-MoM) approach. If you are familiar with Maxwell's equations but new to computational electromagnetics, the key conceptual shift is understanding how surface integral equations transform volumetric scattering problems into boundary-only formulations.

We will derive the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) from first principles, explain why surface methods are particularly well-suited for open-region scattering, and compare the computational trade-offs with volume-based methods like Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD).

## 1. Maxwell's Equations and the Scattering Problem

### 1.1 Time-Harmonic Maxwell's Equations

We begin with time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in free space (using the $e^{+i\omega t}$ convention):

```math
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -i\omega\mu_0 \mathbf{H} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &= i\omega\epsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \rho/\epsilon_0 \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{H} &= 0
\end{aligned}
```

For scattering problems, we decompose the total field into incident and scattered components:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{E}^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r}) &= \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r}) &= \mathbf{H}^{\text{inc}}(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{H}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r})
\end{aligned}
```

The incident field $(\mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}, \mathbf{H}^{\text{inc}})$ is known (e.g., a plane wave), while the scattered field $(\mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}, \mathbf{H}^{\text{sca}})$ arises from interaction with scattering objects.

### 1.2 Boundary Conditions for Perfect Electric Conductors (PEC)

For a perfect electric conductor (PEC), the tangential component of the total electric field must vanish on the surface $\Gamma$:

```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{0}, \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Gamma
```

where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward unit normal to the surface. This implies:

```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) = -\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}(\mathbf{r}), \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Gamma
```

The scattered field is radiated by equivalent surface currents $\mathbf{J}_s$ and $\mathbf{M}_s$ on $\Gamma$, but for PEC scattering, we only need the electric surface current $\mathbf{J}_s$ (since $\mathbf{M}_s = \mathbf{0}$ on PEC).

### 1.3 Impedance Boundary Condition (Generalization)

For surfaces with finite impedance $Z_s$, the boundary condition is:

```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r}) = Z_s \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}), \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Gamma
```

where $\mathbf{J}_s$ is the surface current density. This reduces to the PEC case when $Z_s = 0$.

---

## 2. Green's Function Solution of Maxwell's Equations

### 2.1 Free-Space Green's Function

The free-space scalar Green's function $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$ satisfies the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation:

```math
(\nabla^2 + k^2) G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = -\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')
```

with outgoing wave boundary condition, where $k = \omega\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}$ is the wavenumber. The solution is:

```math
G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = \frac{e^{-ik|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|}}{4\pi|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|}
```

This Green's function automatically satisfies the radiation condition at infinity, which is a key advantage of integral equation methods.

### 2.2 Vector Potential Formulation

The scattered electric field due to a surface current $\mathbf{J}_s$ can be expressed using the magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) &= \mu_0 \int_\Gamma G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS' \\
\mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) &= -i\omega\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) - \nabla\phi(\mathbf{r}) \\
\phi(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{i\omega\epsilon_0} \int_\Gamma G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \nabla' \cdot \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS'
\end{aligned}
```

where $\phi$ is the electric scalar potential. Combining these gives the electric field integral operator:

```math
\mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) = -i\omega\mu_0 \int_\Gamma \left[\mathbf{I} + \frac{1}{k^2}\nabla\nabla\right] G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS'
```

This is the core operator that maps surface currents to scattered fields.

---

## 3. Derivation of the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE)

### 3.1 Tangential Projection

Applying the tangential projection operator $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times (\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \cdot)$ to the scattered field expression and enforcing the PEC boundary condition gives:

```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) = -\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}(\mathbf{r}), \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Gamma
```

Substituting the integral operator leads to the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE):

```math
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \left[-i\omega\mu_0 \int_\Gamma \left(\mathbf{I} + \frac{1}{k^2}\nabla\nabla\right) G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS'\right] = -\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}(\mathbf{r})
```

### 3.2 Mixed-Potential Form

A more computationally friendly form is obtained by integrating the $\nabla\nabla$ operator by parts:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}}(\mathbf{r}) = &-i\omega\mu_0 \int_\Gamma G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS' \\
&+ \frac{i}{\omega\epsilon_0} \nabla \int_\Gamma G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \nabla' \cdot \mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}') \, dS'
\end{aligned}
```

This separates the vector potential contribution (first term) from the scalar potential contribution (second term), which is crucial for stable numerical implementation.

### 3.3 Why This is an Integral Equation

The EFIE has the form:

```math
\mathcal{T}[\mathbf{J}_s](\mathbf{r}) = -\mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}_t(\mathbf{r}), \quad \mathbf{r} \in \Gamma
```

where $\mathcal{T}$ is a linear integral operator mapping the unknown surface current $\mathbf{J}_s$ to the tangential scattered field. This is a **Fredholm integral equation of the first kind**—the unknown function appears only inside the integral.

## 4. Surface vs. Volume Discretization: Dimensional Analysis

### 4.1 Scaling Laws for Unknown Counts

Consider scattering from an object with characteristic size $L$ discretized with resolution $h$ (typical element size). The number of unknowns scales as:

- **Volume methods (FEM, FDTD):** $N_{\text{vol}} \sim (L/h)^3$
- **Surface methods (MoM, BEM):** $N_{\text{surf}} \sim (L/h)^2$

For example, with $L = 1\ \text{m}$ and $h = 1\ \text{cm}$:
- Volume: $N_{\text{vol}} \sim 100^3 = 10^6$ unknowns
- Surface: $N_{\text{surf}} \sim 100^2 = 10^4$ unknowns

The surface method reduces the unknown count by **one order of magnitude** in terms of $L/h$.

### 4.2 Why This Matters for High-Frequency Problems

At high frequencies, $h$ must be small relative to wavelength $\lambda$ (typically $h < \lambda/10$). As frequency increases:
- $\lambda$ decreases → $h$ must decrease
- $L/h$ increases rapidly
- Volume methods become prohibitively expensive due to cubic scaling

Surface methods mitigate this through quadratic rather than cubic scaling, making them attractive for high-frequency scattering.

### 4.3 The Dense Matrix Trade-off

While surface methods have fewer unknowns, the EFIE operator $\mathcal{T}$ is **non-local**—every basis function couples to every other basis function through the Green's function. This leads to dense matrices:

- **Storage:** $O(N^2)$ for dense $N \times N$ matrix
- **Direct solve cost:** $O(N^3)$ for LU factorization
- **Matrix-vector multiply:** $O(N^2)$ (no sparsity)

This is the fundamental trade-off: fewer unknowns but dense coupling versus more unknowns but sparse coupling (in volume methods).

## 5. The Method of Moments (MoM) Framework

### 5.1 Basis Expansion

The Method of Moments discretizes the integral equation by expanding the unknown surface current in a finite basis:

```math
\mathbf{J}_s(\mathbf{r}) \approx \sum_{n=1}^N I_n \mathbf{f}_n(\mathbf{r})
```

where $\{\mathbf{f}_n\}_{n=1}^N$ are vector basis functions defined on the surface $\Gamma$, and $\{I_n\}_{n=1}^N$ are complex expansion coefficients.

### 5.2 Testing (Weighted Residual Method)

We form the residual:

```math
\mathcal{R}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathcal{T}\left[\sum_{n=1}^N I_n \mathbf{f}_n\right](\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}_t(\mathbf{r})
```

and enforce orthogonality to a set of testing functions $\{\mathbf{w}_m\}_{m=1}^N$:

```math
\langle \mathbf{w}_m, \mathcal{R} \rangle = 0, \quad m = 1,\dots,N
```

where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes an appropriate inner product on $\Gamma$.

### 5.3 Galerkin Method

In the Galerkin approach, we choose testing functions equal to basis functions: $\mathbf{w}_m = \mathbf{f}_m$. This leads to a symmetric system (for self-adjoint operators) and often provides optimal convergence properties.

The discretized system becomes:

```math
\sum_{n=1}^N Z_{mn} I_n = V_m, \quad m = 1,\dots,N
```

with matrix elements:

```math
\begin{aligned}
Z_{mn} &= \langle \mathbf{f}_m, \mathcal{T}[\mathbf{f}_n] \rangle \\
V_m &= -\langle \mathbf{f}_m, \mathbf{E}^{\text{inc}}_t \rangle
\end{aligned}
```

### 5.4 Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) Basis Functions

This package uses Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions, which are defined on pairs of triangular elements sharing a common edge. RWG functions:
1. Ensure current continuity across element boundaries
2. Have linear variation within each triangle
3. Enforce charge conservation through divergence properties
4. Provide a natural physical interpretation (edge currents)

We will explore RWG functions in detail in Chapter 3.

## 6. Comparison with Other Numerical Methods

### 6.1 Finite Element Method (FEM)
- **Domain:** Discretizes volume surrounding scatterer
- **Matrix:** Sparse, banded structure
- **Boundary conditions:** Requires artificial absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) or perfectly matched layers (PMLs)
- **Advantages:** Handles inhomogeneous media naturally
- **Disadvantages:** Larger unknown count for open-region problems

### 6.2 Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
- **Domain:** Discretizes volume with staggered grid
- **Approach:** Solves Maxwell's equations directly in time domain
- **Boundary conditions:** Requires ABCs/PMLs
- **Advantages:** Broadband results from single simulation, intuitive
- **Disadvantages:** Staircasing errors, difficult for curved surfaces

### 6.3 Method of Moments (MoM)
- **Domain:** Discretizes only the scattering surface
- **Matrix:** Dense, full coupling
- **Boundary conditions:** Built into Green's function (radiation condition)
- **Advantages:** Exact radiation condition, fewer unknowns for smooth surfaces
- **Disadvantages:** Dense matrices limit problem size, difficult for inhomogeneous media

### 6.4 Hybrid Methods

In practice, hybrid methods combine strengths:
- **FEM-MoM:** FEM for complex interior regions, MoM for exterior radiation
- **MLFMM-MoM:** Multilevel fast multipole method accelerates MoM matrix-vector products
- **IE-FFT:** Integral equation with fast Fourier transform acceleration

This package focuses on the **dense MoM reference implementation** for accuracy verification and gradient-based optimization studies.

## 7. Computational Complexity Analysis

### 7.1 Memory Requirements

For $N$ RWG unknowns, a dense complex matrix requires:

```math
\text{Memory (GiB)} = \frac{16 N^2}{1024^3}
```

where 16 bytes = 8 bytes for real part + 8 bytes for imaginary part (double precision complex).

### 7.2 Operation Counts

- **Matrix fill:** $O(N^2)$ operations (each $Z_{mn}$ requires numerical integration)
- **Direct solve (LU):** $O(N^3)$ operations
- **Matrix-vector multiply:** $O(N^2)$ operations
- **Iterative solve (CG/GMRES):** $O(kN^2)$ operations for $k$ iterations

### 7.3 Practical Scaling Limits

For a typical workstation with 64 GB RAM:
- Maximum $N \approx \sqrt{64\times 1024^3 / 16} \approx 65,\!000$
- LU factorization time: $O((6.5\times 10^4)^3) \sim 2.7\times 10^{14}$ operations
- At 100 GFLOP/s: $\sim 2.7\times 10^3$ seconds $\approx 45$ minutes

This illustrates why dense MoM is practical for moderate-sized problems ($N < 10^4$) but requires acceleration techniques (FMM, FFT) or iterative methods for larger problems.

## 8. What This Package Solves

The `DifferentiableMoM.jl` package solves the discretized EFIE system:

```math
\mathbf{Z}\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{V}
```

where:
- $\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{C}^{N\times N}$ is the MoM impedance matrix
- $\mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{C}^{N}$ is the vector of RWG expansion coefficients
- $\mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{C}^{N}$ is the excitation vector from incident field

Once $\mathbf{I}$ is computed, all derived quantities are obtained through linear or quadratic operations:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{Far field:} & \quad \mathbf{E}^\infty = \mathbf{G}\mathbf{I} \quad (\text{linear}) \\
\text{Objective:} & \quad J = \mathbf{I}^\dagger\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{I} \quad (\text{quadratic}) \\
\text{Gradients:} & \quad \frac{\partial J}{\partial\theta_p} \text{ via adjoint method}
\end{aligned}
```

This structure enables efficient gradient computation for optimization, which is the focus of Part III of this documentation.

## 9. Summary and Key Insights

### 9.1 Why Integral Equations for Open-Region Scattering?

1. **Exact radiation condition:** The free-space Green's function $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$ automatically satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition, eliminating the need for artificial absorbing boundaries.

2. **Dimensional reduction:** Surface discretization reduces the unknown count from $O((L/h)^3)$ to $O((L/h)^2)$, where $L$ is object size and $h$ is mesh resolution.

3. **Physical transparency:** Surface currents $\mathbf{J}_s$ have direct physical interpretation as actual induced currents on conductors.

4. **Accuracy for smooth surfaces:** For perfectly conducting or impedance surfaces, the surface current representation is mathematically exact (no volumetric field approximation needed).

### 9.2 Trade-offs and Practical Considerations

1. **Dense matrices:** While having fewer unknowns, MoM produces fully populated matrices requiring $O(N^2)$ storage and $O(N^3)$ direct solve time.

2. **Singular integrals:** The Green's function singularity at $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}'$ requires special quadrature techniques (discussed in Chapter 4).

3. **Frequency scaling:** MoM complexity increases with frequency due to:
   - Finer mesh required ($h \propto \lambda$)
   - Larger electrical size ($L/\lambda$ increases)
   - Potential ill-conditioning at low frequencies

4. **Acceleration methods:** For large problems, fast algorithms (FMM, FFT, MLFMA) reduce matrix-vector products from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N\log N)$ or $O(N)$.

### 9.3 The DifferentiableMoM.jl Philosophy

This package implements a **reference dense MoM solver** with emphasis on:

1. **Operator transparency:** Clear mapping between mathematical formulas and code implementation.
2. **Differentiable design:** Accurate gradient computation via adjoint method for optimization.
3. **Verification focus:** Internal consistency checks and validation against analytical solutions.
4. **Educational value:** Code structured to teach MoM fundamentals while providing research capabilities.

While dense MoM limits problem size, it provides a gold standard for verifying accelerated methods and serves as an ideal testbed for gradient-based optimization studies.

## 10. Exercises and Problems

### 10.1 Conceptual Questions

1. **Derivation practice:** Starting from Maxwell's equations in differential form, derive the vector potential expression for the scattered electric field:
   $\mathbf{E}^{\text{sca}} = -i\omega\mathbf{A} - \nabla\phi$.

2. **Boundary condition analysis:** Explain why the impedance boundary condition $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{E}^{\text{tot}} = Z_s \mathbf{J}_s$ reduces to the PEC condition when $Z_s = 0$, and to the PMC (perfect magnetic conductor) condition when $Z_s \to \infty$.

3. **Green's function properties:** Prove that the free-space Green's function $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = e^{-ikR}/(4\pi R)$ satisfies:
   - The Helmholtz equation: $(\nabla^2 + k^2)G = -\delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')$
   - The reciprocity relation: $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = G(\mathbf{r}',\mathbf{r})$
   - The far-field approximation: $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') \sim e^{-ikr}/(4\pi r) e^{ik\hat{\mathbf{r}}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}$ as $r \to \infty$

### 10.2 Numerical Estimation Problems

1. **Memory estimation:** For a spherical scatterer of radius $a = 1\ \text{m}$ at frequency $f = 300\ \text{MHz}$ ($\lambda = 1\ \text{m}$), estimate the number of RWG unknowns $N$ assuming 10 triangles per wavelength squared. Compute the dense matrix memory requirement in GiB.

2. **Scaling analysis:** Show analytically that doubling the electrical size of an object (keeping mesh density constant in terms of $\lambda$) increases:
   - Surface unknown count by 4×
   - Dense matrix memory by 16×  
   - Direct solve time by 64× (for $O(N^3)$ scaling)

3. **Comparison study:** Compare MoM and FEM for a $1\ \text{m} \times 1\ \text{m}$ plate at 3 GHz ($\lambda = 0.1\ \text{m}$). Assume:
   - MoM: 100 triangles/$\lambda^2$, $h = \lambda/10$
   - FEM: Volume extends $\lambda/2$ from plate, 10 cells/$\lambda$
   Compute and compare unknown counts for both methods.
