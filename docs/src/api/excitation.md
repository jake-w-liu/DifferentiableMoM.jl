# API: Excitation System

## Purpose

Reference for incident-field excitation assembly. The excitation system provides a unified interface for assembling the right-hand-side (RHS) vector `v` in the MoM equation `Z * I = v`. Different physical excitation types (plane waves, ports, dipoles, imported fields, pattern feeds) are all handled through a single `assemble_excitation` interface.

For full physics derivations and guidance on choosing between excitation types, see `fundamentals/06-excitation-theory-and-usage.md`.

---

## Excitation Types

All excitation types inherit from `AbstractExcitation`. You create an excitation using a constructor function (e.g., `make_plane_wave`), then pass it to `assemble_excitation` to get the RHS vector.

### `PlaneWaveExcitation`

A uniform plane wave illumination -- the most common excitation for scattering problems and RCS computation.

**Fields:**
- `k_vec::Vec3`: Wave vector (rad/m). Direction of propagation is along `k_vec`; magnitude is `|k_vec| = k = 2*pi/lambda`.
- `E0::Float64`: Amplitude of the electric field (V/m).
- `pol::Vec3`: Polarization direction (unit vector, must be orthogonal to `k_vec`).

**Constructor:**
```julia
pw = make_plane_wave(k_vec, E0, pol)
```

**Example:**
```julia
# z-propagating, x-polarized plane wave at 1 GHz
freq = 1e9
lambda0 = 3e8 / freq
k = 2pi / lambda0
pw = make_plane_wave(Vec3(0, 0, -k), 1.0, Vec3(1, 0, 0))
v = assemble_excitation(mesh, rwg, pw)
```

---

### `DeltaGapExcitation`

A voltage source applied across a single RWG edge. This is the simplest antenna feed model: a uniform electric field is applied across the gap, driving current into the structure.

**Fields:**
- `edge::Int`: RWG edge index where the gap is placed.
- `voltage::ComplexF64`: Gap voltage (V).
- `gap_length::Float64`: Physical gap length (m). The excitation field is `V/gap_length` applied across the edge.

**Constructor:**
```julia
gap = make_delta_gap(edge, voltage, gap_length)
```

**Choosing the edge:** The delta-gap edge should be at the antenna feed point. For a center-fed dipole, place it at the middle edge.

---

### `PortExcitation`

Port excitation defined by a set of RWG edges with applied voltage. This generalizes `DeltaGapExcitation` to multi-edge ports.

**Fields:**
- `port_edges::Vector{Int}`: RWG edge indices forming the port.
- `voltage::ComplexF64`: Port voltage (V).
- `impedance::ComplexF64`: Port impedance (stored for model completeness; the present RHS assembly uses only `voltage` and `port_edges`).

**Note:** The RHS contribution is edge-localized: `v_m = V / l_m` for edges in the port, zero otherwise.

---

### `DipoleExcitation`

Electric or magnetic dipole source. The incident field from the dipole is computed at each quadrature point on the mesh and integrated against the RWG basis functions.

**Fields:**
- `position::Vec3`: Dipole position (m).
- `moment::CVec3`: Dipole moment (electric: C*m, magnetic: A*m^2).
- `orientation::Vec3`: Dipole orientation metadata (unit vector).
- `type::Symbol`: `:electric` or `:magnetic`.
- `frequency::Float64`: Source frequency (Hz).

**Constructor:**
```julia
dip = make_dipole(position, moment, orientation, type, frequency)
```

**Placement:** The dipole must not be placed on the mesh surface itself (the field is singular at the source). Place it at least a fraction of a wavelength away from the scatterer.

---

### `LoopExcitation`

Circular current loop source. Models a small magnetic source.

**Fields:**
- `center::Vec3`: Loop center (m).
- `normal::Vec3`: Loop normal direction (unit vector).
- `radius::Float64`: Loop radius (m).
- `current::ComplexF64`: Loop current (A).
- `frequency::Float64`: Source frequency (Hz).

**Constructor:**
```julia
lp = make_loop(center, normal, radius, current, frequency)
```

---

### `ImportedExcitation`

A general imported or distributed source model. You provide a function `source(r) -> CVec3` that returns the incident field (or surface current density) at any point `r` on the mesh. This is the most flexible excitation type, supporting externally computed fields from other solvers or measurements.

**Fields:**
- `source_func::Function`: Spatial function `source(r) -> CVec3`.
- `kind::Symbol`: How to interpret the source function:
  - `:electric_field` -- `source(r)` is the incident electric field `E_inc(r)` directly.
  - `:surface_current_density` -- `source(r)` is an impressed surface current density `J_s(r)`, mapped via `E_inc(r) = eta_equiv * J_s(r)` (local equivalent-sheet approximation).
- `eta_equiv::ComplexF64`: Equivalent sheet impedance, used only when `kind=:surface_current_density`.
- `min_quad_order::Int`: Minimum quadrature order for assembly (mapped to supported orders 1, 3, 4, 7).

**Constructors:**
```julia
# Recommended
exc = make_imported_excitation(source_func; kind=:electric_field,
                               eta_equiv=376.73+0im, min_quad_order=3)

# Direct constructor
exc = ImportedExcitation(source_func; kind=:electric_field, ...)
```

**When to use each `kind`:**

| `kind` | Use when... | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `:electric_field` | You know `E_inc(r)` at the scatterer (from external solver, analytical formula, etc.) | Horn antenna near-field import, external full-wave simulation |
| `:surface_current_density` | You have an impressed surface current `J_s(r)` and want a local equivalent-sheet mapping `E = eta * J_s` | Aperture-based feed models, sheet-like sources |

**Scope and limitations:**

`ImportedExcitation` is an **RHS field model** only. It does not solve an auxiliary radiation problem for the source. For `:surface_current_density`, the mapping `E = eta * J_s` is a local approximation valid near sheet-like or aperture sources; it is **not** a rigorous dyadic Green's function radiation integral.

For rigorous imported sources, compute `E_inc(r)` externally and use `kind=:electric_field`.

---

### `PatternFeedExcitation`

Incident field synthesized from imported spherical far-field coefficients. Use this when you have radiation pattern data (e.g., from a horn antenna measurement or simulation) and want to use it as a feed illuminating a reflector or scatterer.

**Fields:**
- `theta::Vector{Float64}`: Polar-angle grid (rad), strictly increasing in [0, pi].
- `phi::Vector{Float64}`: Azimuth grid (rad), strictly increasing over one open 2*pi period.
- `Ftheta::Matrix{ComplexF64}`: Far-field coefficient F_theta(theta, phi).
- `Fphi::Matrix{ComplexF64}`: Far-field coefficient F_phi(theta, phi).
- `frequency::Float64`: Frequency (Hz).
- `phase_center::Vec3`: Pattern phase-center location (m).
- `convention::Symbol`: `:exp_plus_iwt` or `:exp_minus_iwt` for the imported data.

**The field model is:**

```
E(r) = (exp(-ikR)/R) * [F_theta * theta_hat + F_phi * phi_hat]
```

where `R = |r - r_c|` is the distance from the phase center.

**Constructors:**
```julia
# From arrays
pf = make_pattern_feed(theta, phi, Ftheta, Fphi, frequency;
                        phase_center=Vec3(0,0,0), convention=:exp_plus_iwt)

# From pattern objects (RadiationPatterns.jl compatible)
pf = make_pattern_feed(Etheta_pattern, Ephi_pattern, frequency; ...)
```

The second form accepts pattern objects with `.x`, `.y`, `.U` fields (e.g., `RadiationPatterns.jl` `Pattern` objects).

**Important:** Use two complex patterns (E_theta and E_phi), not a power-only pattern, to preserve polarization and phase.

---

### `MultiExcitation`

Combination of multiple excitations with complex weights. The resulting RHS is a weighted sum of individual excitation vectors.

**Fields:**
- `excitations::Vector{AbstractExcitation}`: List of excitations.
- `weights::Vector{ComplexF64}`: Weight for each excitation.

**Constructor:**
```julia
multi = make_multi_excitation(excitations, weights=nothing)
```
If `weights` is not provided, equal weights (all 1.0) are used.

---

## Core Functions

### `plane_wave_field(r, k_vec, E0, pol)`

**Parameters:**
- `r::Vec3`: Observation point (meters).
- `k_vec::Vec3`: Wave vector (rad/m).
- `E0`: Amplitude (V/m).
- `pol::Vec3`: Polarization (unit vector).

**Returns:** `CVec3` electric field phasor.

---

### `assemble_v_plane_wave(mesh, rwg, k_vec, E0, pol; quad_order=3)`

Assemble the excitation vector for a plane wave directly. This is a convenience function equivalent to `assemble_excitation(mesh, rwg, make_plane_wave(k_vec, E0, pol))`.

**Parameters:**
- `mesh::TriMesh`, `rwg::RWGData`: Mesh and basis data.
- `k_vec::Vec3`: Wave vector (rad/m).

---

### `assemble_excitation(mesh, rwg, excitation; quad_order=3)`

**The unified excitation assembly function.** Assembles the RHS vector `v` for any `AbstractExcitation` subtype.

```

The integral is over the support of basis `m`, and `E_inc_t` is the tangential component of the incident electric field.

- `excitations::Vector{<:AbstractExcitation}`: List of excitations.
- `quad_order::Int=3`: Quadrature order.

**Returns:** `Matrix{ComplexF64}` of size `N x M` where each column is the RHS for one excitation.

---

## Assembly Details

### Plane Wave
The excitation vector is computed via quadrature:

```
v_m = -integral_{S_m} f_m(r) . E_inc(r) dS
```

where `E_inc(r) = pol * E0 * exp(-i k . r)` and `S_m` is the union of the two support triangles of basis `m`.

### Port and Delta-Gap
Port excitations use edge-localized voltage injection:

```
v_m = (V / l_m) * delta_{m in port}
```

where `l_m` is the edge length. For `DeltaGapExcitation`, the gap length `g` is used instead:

```
v_m = (V / g) * delta_{m = gap_edge}
```

### Dipole and Loop Sources

The incident field from the dipole or loop is evaluated at quadrature points on each support triangle and integrated numerically via `dipole_incident_field(r, dipole)` (internal). The explicit field formulas (exp(+iwt) convention) are:

**Electric dipole** (moment `p`, position `r_0`):

```
E(r) = [exp(-ikR) / (4*pi*eps0*R)] * { k^2 (R_hat x p) x R_hat
        + (3 R_hat (R_hat . p) - p) * (1/R^2 - ik/R) }
```

where `R = |r - r_0|` and `R_hat = (r - r_0) / R`. This is the full near-field + far-field electric dipole radiation formula (Balanis, Ch. 4). It includes the 1/R^3 quasi-static term, the 1/R^2 induction term, and the 1/R radiation term.

**Magnetic dipole** (moment `m`, position `r_0`):

```
E(r) = (eta0 / 4*pi) * (k/R^2 + ik^2/R) * exp(-ikR) * (R_hat x m)
```

This follows from Balanis's small circular loop result (Ch. 5): `E_phi = -(eta*k^2*m*sin(theta))/(4*pi*r) * (i + 1/(kr)) * exp(-ikr)`, generalized to 3D vector form. It includes both the 1/R^2 induction term and the 1/R radiation (far-field) term. The quasi-static 1/R^3 term for the magnetic dipole is in H, not E.

**Loop excitation** maps to a magnetic dipole with moment `m = I * pi * a^2 * n_hat`, where `I` is the loop current, `a` is the loop radius, and `n_hat` is the loop normal.

**Far-field pattern coefficients** (used by `make_analytic_dipole_pattern_feed`):

- Electric: `F(r_hat) = k^2 / (4*pi*eps0) * (r_hat x (p x r_hat))`
- Magnetic: `F(r_hat) = i * eta0 * k^2 / (4*pi) * (r_hat x m)`

### Imported/Distributed source (`ImportedExcitation`)
The same quadrature integral is used, with the source function evaluated at each quadrature point. For `kind=:electric_field`, `E_inc = source(r)` directly. For `kind=:surface_current_density`, `E_inc = eta_equiv * source(r)`.

Implementation guards: the source function output is validated as a finite 3-component vector; tuple/array/SVector returns are accepted and converted to complex 3-vectors; malformed outputs throw explicit errors.

### Pattern Feed
Pattern feeds interpolate complex `(F_theta, F_phi)` data on the spherical grid, reconstruct `E_inc` at quadrature points using the phase-center geometry, and assemble via the standard MoM RHS integral.

## Integration with Optimization

All excitations are compatible with the adjoint gradient computation. The excitation vector `v` enters the adjoint equation as a fixed right-hand side; the gradient depends on `Z` and `Q`, not on `v`. This means you can optimize impedance parameters with any excitation type without modifying the adjoint code.

## Notes

- For plane waves, `quad_order=3` is sufficient for typical accuracy.
- Port and delta-gap excitations are local (affect only the specified edges, no quadrature needed).
- Near-field sources (dipole, loop) must be placed away from the mesh surface to avoid singular fields.
- For imported fields, prefer `make_imported_excitation(...)` so `kind` and scaling are explicit.
- If you need a rigorously radiating impressed-current model, use `kind=:electric_field` with externally computed `E_inc`, rather than assuming `E = eta * J` outside sheet-like cases.

---

## Exercises

### Basic
1. Assemble plane-wave excitation with both `assemble_v_plane_wave(...)` and `assemble_excitation(..., make_plane_wave(...))`. Verify they match element-by-element.
2. Create a delta-gap excitation on edge 5 and inspect which entries of `v` are non-zero.

### Practical
1. Set up a two-port excitation and solve for currents. Compute the input impedance at each port.
2. Combine plane wave and dipole excitations with weights 0.6 and 0.4 using `MultiExcitation`.

### Advanced
1. Write a function that imports field data from a CSV file and creates an `ImportedExcitation`. Compare the RHS against a plane-wave reference.
2. Use `make_analytic_dipole_pattern_feed` to create a pattern feed, then compare its RHS against the direct `DipoleExcitation` RHS for the same dipole. Quantify the agreement.
